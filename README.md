# Analyze

The `Analyze` repository serves as a robust data processing pipeline designed to extract valuable insights from structured data. It leverages Python and the Pandas library to perform analysis on an input dataset (`data.xlsx`, converted to `data.csv`), producing a comprehensive `result.json` output. This `result.json` is automatically published and made accessible via GitHub Pages, offering a structured, machine-readable summary of the analysis that can be consumed by other systems or visualized by a separate client-side application.

## How It Works

The core of this project is the `execute.py` Python script. This script performs the following actions:

1.  **Data Ingestion:** It reads the `data.csv` file, which is a processed version of the initial `data.xlsx` dataset, from the `/input` directory.
2.  **Data Analysis:** Utilizes the powerful Pandas library to conduct specific data analysis operations.
3.  **Result Generation:** Outputs the findings of the analysis into a `result.json` file.

The entire process, from linting the Python code with `ruff` to executing the analysis and publishing the results, is automated through a GitHub Actions workflow. Upon every push to the repository, the workflow generates an updated `result.json` and publishes it to GitHub Pages, ensuring the latest analytical output is always available online.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized to clearly separate input data, analytical scripts, and workflow configurations:

-   `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Defines the Continuous Integration (CI) and deployment workflow, including linting, script execution, and GitHub Pages publishing.
-   `execute.py`: The main Python script responsible for performing the data analysis.
-   `input/`: This directory contains the input data files.
    -   `data.csv`: The primary dataset used for analysis, derived from `data.xlsx`.

## How to Use / Run

### 1. Local Execution (Python Script)

To run the analysis script locally:

a.  **Prerequisites:**
    -   Python 3.11+
    -   Pandas 2.3
    -   Ruff (for linting)

b.  **Installation:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install pandas ruff
    ```

c.  **Run the script:**
    Ensure `data.csv` is present in the `input/` directory.
    ```bash
    python execute.py > result.json
    ```
    This will generate `result.json` in your current directory.

### 2. Viewing Published Analysis (GitHub Pages)

The `result.json` file is automatically generated and published via GitHub Pages for public access. You can access the latest analytical output by navigating to the GitHub Pages URL associated with this repository. The URL typically follows the format: `https://[YOUR_USERNAME].github.io/Analyze/result.json`.

## Technologies Used

-   **Python 3.11+**: The primary programming language for the analysis script.
-   **Pandas 2.3**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
-   **Ruff**: An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, ensuring code quality.
-   **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD pipeline, from linting and testing to deployment.
-   **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the generated `result.json` file, making the analytical output publicly accessible.

## Deployment Notes

This project is configured for continuous deployment using GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

-   The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow triggers on every push to the repository.
-   It runs `ruff` for code quality checks.
-   It executes `python execute.py` and redirects its output to `result.json`.
-   Finally, it deploys this `result.json` file to GitHub Pages.
-   Crucially, `result.json` is *not* committed to the repository; it is generated and deployed exclusively via the CI pipeline, ensuring the published version always reflects the latest code and data.
